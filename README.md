# Road_Detection
This is a repository for my solution on the Road Detection Problem for the research project in WS 2017 for the class "Introduction to machine learning" Author: Athanasios Raptakis

Author:Athanasios Raptakis This repo is my code for the final project of the calss "Introduction to machine Learning" WS/2017 Heidelberg Uni

Project topic Road Detection with machine Learning techniques both static images and video was tackled.
